Relevant Parameters
	AFM Probe Radius: 1250 nm (1.25 um)
	Poisson: 0.5
	Spring Constant: 0.058 N/m

To determine median curve from technical replicates:
	1. Baseline correction
	2. Extension curve
	3. Hertzian (spherical fit): 0% - 20% of the curve
	4. Extract Young's
	5. Determine median curve from the technical replicates
	6. Each curve has above it the measured E from the software as needed

Each exported curve has the contact point zeroed - it occurs at z=0.
Nuclear/cytoplasmic curves are individually reported - fairly consistent distribution
