Notes:
HUVEC 6 has some bottom thresholding issues where there is fluorescence beneath the cell
for the nucleus - I would suggest a bottom cut off

HUVEC 7 has no LMNA staining (photobleach?) - use DAPI instead for modeling

DAPI and LMNA correlate very closely for these modeling/imaging procedure and is used
generally as a secondary confirmation of nuclear localization, here however for cell
7, it's the back up for when LMNA imaging failed
